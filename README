The PTSSpringBoard class provides the functionalities of a springboard as known from the iOS mainscreen. It supports moving and deleting item and uses a delegation pattern, similar to that of the UITableView.

The class should be working on the iPhone (3.3 inch & 4inch) and iPad (although I only really tested the iPhones) and with all interface-orientations.
